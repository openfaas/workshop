## Chaining functions on the client-side

You can pipe the result of one function into another using `curl`, the `faas-cli` or some of your own code. Here's an example:

Pros:

* requires no code - can be done with CLI programs
* fast for development and testing
* easy to model in code

Cons:

* additional latency - each function goes back to the server
* chatty (more messages)

Example:

* Deploy the NodeInfo function from the *Function Store*

* Then push the output from NodeInfo through the Markdown converter

```
$ echo -n "" | faas-cli invoke nodeinfo | faas-cli invoke func_markdown
<p>Hostname: 64767782518c</p>

<p>Platform: linux
Arch: x64
CPU count: 4
Uptime: 1121466</p>
```

You will now see the output of the NodeInfo function decorated with HTML tags such as: `<p>`.

Another example of client-side chaining of functions may be to invoke a function that generates an image, then send that image into another function which adds a watermark.

## Call one function from another

The easiest way to call one function from another is make a call over HTTP via the OpenFaaS *API Gateway*. This call does not need to know the external domain name or IP address, it can simply refer to the API Gateway as `gateway` through a DNS entry.

When accessing a service such as the API gateway from a function it's best practice to use an environmental variable to configure the hostname, this is important for two reasons - the name may change and in Kubernetes a suffix is sometimes needed.

Pros:

* functions can make use of each other directly
* low latency since the functions can access each other on the same network

Cons:

* requires a code library for making the HTTP request

Example:

In Lab 3 we introduced the requests module and used it to call a remote API to get the name of an astronaut aboard the ISS. We can use the same technique to call another function deployed on OpenFaaS.

* Go to the *Function Store* and deploy the *Sentiment Analysis* function. 

The Sentiment Analysis function will tell you the subjectivity and polarity (positivity rating) of any sentence. The result of the function is formatted in JSON as per the example below:

```
echo -n "California is great, it's always sunny there." | faas-cli invoke sentimentanalysis
{"polarity": 0.8, "sentence_count": 1, "subjectivity": 0.75}
```

So the result shows us that our test sentence was both very subjective (75%) and very positive (80%). The values for these two fields are always between `-1.00` and `1.00`.

The following code can be used to call the *Sentiment Analysis* function or any other function:

```python
    test_sentence = "California is great, it's always sunny there."
    r = requests.get("http://gateway:8080/function/sentimentanalysis", text= test_sentence)
```

Or via an environmental variable:

```python
    gateway_hostname = os.getenv("gateway_hostname", "gateway") # uses a default of "gateway" for when "gateway_hostname" is not set
    test_sentence = "California is great, it's always sunny there."
    r = requests.get("http://" + gateway_hostname + ":8080/function/sentimentanalysis", text= test_sentence)
```

Since the result is always in JSON format we can make use of the helper function `.json()` to convert the response:

```python
    result = r.json()
    if result["polarity" > 0.45]:
        print("That was probably positive")
    else:
        print("That was neutral or negative")
```

Now create a new function in Python and it all together

```python
    gateway_hostname = os.getenv("gateway_hostname", "gateway") # uses a default of "gateway" for when "gateway_hostname" is not set
    test_sentence = "California is great, it's always sunny there."
    r = requests.get("http://" + gateway_hostname + ":8080/function/sentimentanalysis", text= test_sentence)
    result = r.json()
    if result["polarity" > 0.45]:
        print("That was probably positive")
    else:
        print("That was neutral or negative")
```

* Remember to add `requests` to your `requirements.txt` file

Note: you do not need to modify or alter the source for the SentimentAnalysis function, we have already deployed it and will access it via the API gateway.

Now move onto [Lab 7](lab7.md)
