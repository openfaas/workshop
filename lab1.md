# Lab 1 - Preparing OpenFaaS

OpenFaaS runs on top of several major platforms including Docker Swarm and Kubernetes. For this tutorial we will get started with Docker Swarm on your local computer.

The basic primitive for any OpenFaaS function is a Docker image, which is built using the `faas-cli` tool-chain.

## Pre-requisites:

### Docker

For Mac

* [Docker CE for Mac Edge Edition](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)

For Windows 

* Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise only
* [Docker CE for Windows](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)

Linux - Ubuntu or Debian

* Docker CE for Linux

> You can install Docker CE from the [Docker Store](https://store.docker.com).

### Setup a single-node Docker Swarm

OpenFaaS works with Docker Swarm and Kubernetes. For this workshop we will use Docker Swarm because it's easier to set up but there are [deployment guides for both options in the documentation](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/tree/master/guide).

On your laptop or VM setup a single-node Docker Swarm:

```
$ docker swarm init
```

> If you receive an error then pass the `--advertise-addr` parameter along with your laptop's IP address.

### Docker Hub

Sign up for a Docker Hub account. The [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) allows you to publish your Docker images on the Internet for use on multi-node clusters or to share with the wider community. We will be using the Docker Hub to publish our functions during the workshop.

You can sign up here: [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com)

> Note: The Docker Hub can also be setup to automate builds of Docker images.

### OpenFaaS CLI

You can install the OpenFaaS CLI with `brew` on a Mac or with a utility script on Mac or Linux:

```
$ curl -sL cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh
```

On Windows download the the latest `faas-cli.exe` from the [releases page](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli). You can place it in a local directory or in the C:\Windows path so that it's available from a command prompt.

> If you're an advanced Windows user, place the CLI in a directory of your choice and then add that folder to your PATH environmental variable.

We will use the `faas-cli` to scaffold new functions, build, deploy and invoke functions. You can find out commands available for the cli with `faas-cli --help`.

### Deploy OpenFaaS

The instructions for deploying OpenFaaS change from time to time as we strive to make this easier. Head over to the official deployment guide in the official guide and follow the steps:

* [Deployment guide](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/guide/deployment_swarm.md)

You should now have OpenFaaS deployed. If you are on a shared WiFi connection at an event then it may take several minutes to pull down all the Docker images and start them.

Check the services show `1/1` and `running` on this screen:

```
$ docker service ls
```

Now move onto [Lab 2](./lab2.md)
