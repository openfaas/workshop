## Install latest `kubectl`

Install `kubectl` for your operating system using the instructions below or the [official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

* Linux

```sh
export VER=$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$VER/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
chmod +x kubectl
mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/
```

* MacOS

```sh
export VER=$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$VER/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl.exe
chmod +x kubectl
mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/
```

* Windows

```sh
export VER=$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$VER/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe
chmod +x kubectl.exe
mkdir -p $HOME/bin/
mv kubectl $HOME/bin/
```

## Setup a Kubernetes cluster

You can follow the labs whilst using Kubernetes, but you may need to make some small changes along the way. The service address for the gateway changes from `http://gateway:8080` to `http://gateway.openfaas:8080`. As far as possible these differences have been documented and alternatives are provided in each lab.

### Create a local cluster on your laptop

#### *k3s using k3d*

If you have Docker on your computer, then you can use `k3d` from Rancher Labs. It installs a lightweight version of Kubernetes called `k3s` and runs it within a Docker container, meaning it will work on any computer that has Docker.

* [Install k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d)

* Start a cluster

```sh
$ k3d create
INFO[0000] Created cluster network with ID 9a7d5887754d3e317b5c1500f706a5ae602077a18bc71bcedb9fae86ebd84c0b 
INFO[0000] Created docker volume  k3d-k3s-default-images 
INFO[0000] Creating cluster [k3s-default]               
INFO[0000] Creating server using docker.io/rancher/k3s:v0.9.1... 
INFO[0000] SUCCESS: created cluster [k3s-default]       
```

Switch into the k3d context:

```sh
export KUBECONFIG="$(k3d get-kubeconfig --name='k3s-default')"
kubectl cluster-info 
```

> Note: You have to run this on any new terminal you open.

#### _Docker for Mac_

* [Install Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/docker-for-mac/install/)

> Note that Kubernetes is only available in Docker for Mac 17.12 CE and higher

#### _With Minikube_

* To install Minikube download the proper installer from [latest release](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases) depending on your platform.

* Now run Minikube with

```
$ minikube start
```

The minikube VM is exposed to the host system via a host-only IP address. Check this IP with `minikube ip`.
This is the IP you will later use for the gateway URL.

> Note: Minikube also requires a Hypervisor such as VirtualBox or Hyperkit (on MacOS). Follow the minikube instructions and documentation

### Create a remote cluster on the cloud

You can create a remote cluster in the cloud and enjoy the same experience as if you were developing locally whilst saving on RAM/CPU and battery. The costs for running a cluster for 1-2 days is minimal.

#### _Run on DigitalOcean's Kubernetes Service_

You can use free credits to create a cluster through DigitalOcean's UI.

The DigitalOcean dashboard will then guide you through how to configure your `kubectl` and `KUBECONFIG` file for use in the labs.

* [Claim your free credits - $50 in credit over 30 days.](https://m.do.co/c/8d4e75e9886f)

Even if you have already claimed free credit, the running costs for a 2-3 node cluster for 24-48 hours is negligible.

* Click on *Kubernetes* on the left panel of the dashboard and then click "Enable Limited Access"

* Once logged in, click the *Kubernetes* menu item and create a Cluster.

It is recommended to use the latest Kubernetes version available and the to select your nearest Datacenter region to minimize latency.

* Under "Add node pool(s)"

Use 2x 4GB / 2vCPU

> Note: You can add more capacity at a later time, if required

* Download the [doctl](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl#installing-doctl) CLI and place it in your path.

* Create an [API Key in your DigitalOcean dashboard](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens/new)

Keep track of your API key (copy it to clipboard)

* Authenticate the CLI

```sh
$ doctl auth init
```

Paste in your API key

* Now get the cluster's name:

```sh
$ doctl k8s cluster list
GUID    workshop-lon1      nyc1      1.13.5-do.1    provisioning    workshop-lon1-1
```

* Save a config file so that `kubectl` is pointing at the new cluster:

```sh
$ doctl k8s cluster kubeconfig save workshop-lon1
```

You now need to switch your Kubernetes context to point at the new cluster.

Find the cluster name with `kubectl config get-contexts`, if it's not highlighted type in `kubectl config set-context <context-name>`.

#### _Run on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)_

Login into Google Cloud, create a project and enable billing for it. If you donâ€™t have an account you can sign up [here](https://cloud.google.com/free/) for free credits.

Install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs) - this will make the `gcloud` and `kubectl` commands available.
For Windows follow the instructions from the [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/#windows).

After installing the gcloud command line utility, configure your project with `gcloud init` and set the default project, compute region and zone (replace `PROJECT_ID` with your own project):

```sh
$ gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID 
$ gcloud config set compute/region us-central1
$ gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a
```

Enable the Kubernetes service:

```sh
$ gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
```

Install kubectl:

```sh
gcloud components install kubectl
```

Create a Kubernetes cluster:

```sh
$ gcloud container clusters create openfaas \
--zone=us-central1-a \
--num-nodes=1 \
--machine-type=n1-standard-2 \
--disk-size=30 \
--no-enable-cloud-logging
```

Set up credentials for `kubectl`:

```sh
$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials openfaas
```

Create a cluster admin role binding:

```sh
$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding "cluster-admin-$(whoami)" \
--clusterrole=cluster-admin \
--user="$(gcloud config get-value core/account)"
```

Now verify `kubectl` is configured to the GKE cluster:

```
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME                                   STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
gke-name-default-pool-eceef152-qjmt   Ready     <none>    1h        v1.10.7-gke.2
```

## Configure a registry - The Docker Hub

Sign up for a Docker Hub account. The [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) allows you to publish your Docker images on the Internet for use on multi-node clusters or to share with the wider community. We will be using the Docker Hub to publish our functions during the workshop.

You can sign up here: [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com)

Open a Terminal or Git Bash window and log into the Docker Hub using the username you signed up for above.

```
$ docker login
```

> Note: Tip from community - if you get an error while trying to run this command on a Windows machine, then click on the Docker for Windows icon in the taskbar and log into Docker there instead "Sign in / Create Docker ID".

## Deploy OpenFaaS

The instructions for deploying OpenFaaS change from time to time as we strive to make this even easier.

### Install OpenFaaS

There is a new tool called `k3sup` which can install helm charts, including OpenFaaS. This makes the installation procedure much faster.

#### Install with `k3sup`

* Get k3sup

For Windows:

```sh
curl -SLsf https://get.k3sup.dev/ | sh
```

For MacOS / Linux:

```sh
curl -SLsf https://get.k3sup.dev/ | sudo sh
```

* Install the OpenFaaS app

If you're using a managed cloud Kubernetes service which supplies LoadBalancers, then run the following:

```sh
k3sup app install openfaas --loadbalancer
```

If you're using a local Kubernetes cluster or a VM, then run:

```sh
k3sup app install openfaas
```

#### Or install with helm (advanced)

If you prefer, you can install OpenFaaS using the [helm chart](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-netes/blob/master/chart/openfaas/README.md) instructions.

### Log into your OpenFaaS gateway

* Check the gateway is ready

```sh
kubectl rollout status -n openfaas deploy/gateway
```

If you're using your laptop, a VM, or any other kind of Kubernetes distribution run the following instead:

```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/gateway -n openfaas 8080:8080
```

This command will open a tunnel from your Kubernetes cluster to your local computer so that you can access the OpenFaaS gateway. There are other ways to access OpenFaaS, but that is beyond the scope of this workshop.

Your gateway URL is: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

If you're using a managed cloud Kubernetes service then get the LoadBalancer's IP address or DNS entry from the `EXTERNAL-IP` field from the command below.

```sh
kubectl get svc -o wide gateway-external -n openfaas
```

Your URL will be the IP or DNS entry above on port `8080`.

* Log in:

```sh
export OPENFAAS_URL="" # Populate as above

PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret -n openfaas basic-auth -o jsonpath="{.data.basic-auth-password}" | base64 --decode; echo)
echo -n $PASSWORD | faas-cli login --username admin --password-stdin
```

* Check that `faas-cli list` works:

```sh
faas-cli list
```

Now move onto [Lab 2](lab2.md)
